== Receta

A tutorial I followed available at http://www.angular-rails.com

Allows CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) of a Recipe object.

Fully tested too (front- and back-end)

Available live at http://powerful-gorge-9658.herokuapp.com (might take a while to load unless I set up New Relic)

Enjoy!
